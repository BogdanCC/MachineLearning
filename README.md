# Human Learning Machine Learning

  - (_1) - The hello world of machine learning. Wrote the first classifier (Decision Tree algorithm)
  - (_2) - Used another algorithm (Naive Bayes). Used the toy data set from sklearn (iris data set)
  - (_3) - Used yet another classifier and tried to explain to myself linear regression
  - (_4) - 5th google tutorial (machine learning recipes) where we created an algorithm from scratch
