# Human Learning Machine Learning
This is to document what I'm learning. 
  - (_1) 27.11.2017 - The hello world of machine learning. Wrote the first classifier (Decision Tree algorithm)
  - (_2) 28.11.2017 - Used another algorithm (Naive Bayes). Used the toy data set from sklearn (iris data set)
  - (_3) 29.11.2017 - Used yet another classifier and tried to explain to myself linear regression
  - (_4) 29.01.2018 - 5th google tutorial (machine learning recipes) where we created an algorithm from scratch
